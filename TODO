COMMANDS:
	- pwd (might need regular expression to display accurate message of where we are)
	- cd  (check chdir() system call)
	- ls  (partially done, need to split files from folders)
	- less(use less command (with exec) but if no files display a message)

THINK ABOUT HOW THE ARCHITECTURE WORKS:

	One shell program shell.c :
A infinite loop where we get user inputs and create child processes to handle the commands (execlp() system call or custom function (ex: cd command or the ones with custom messages)
