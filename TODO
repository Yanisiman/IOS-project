Searching file's content : grep command

Need to use these system calls:
link() -> add links to file
unlink() -> remove links (can be used to remove files or symbolic links)
lseek()

Need to use pipes for inter process communication: (probably when we will handle redirection like : echo Hello > testFile)
Need of error control : handle more errors and bad inputs from the user


PROBLEMS TO RESOLVE:
Copy a file: cp command
