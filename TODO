Creating new files: touch command
Searching file's content : grep command
Reading manual file of a command
Finding help : help command (needs some changes -> read the file of the command in the commands folder)
Copy a file: cp command
Read the content of a file: cat command (even if it's not the main purpose of the command)

Need to use these system calls:
link() -> add links to file
unlink() -> remove links (can be used to remove files or symbolic links)
lseek()

Need to use pipes for inter process communication: (probably when we will handle redirection like : echo Hello > testFile)
Need of error control : handle more errors and bad inputs from the user

Optional work to improve:
Implement a server where the players could be the clients and could be playing simultaneously.
