First the permission to access files is divided into three users: 
- The user / owner
- The group
- The others / all

Each type of user on a file has the permission or not to : 
    - read  (4)
    - write  (2)
    - execute (1)

-rwxrwxrwx
drwxr-xr-x (the d stands for directory)

We can use the chmod command to change the permissions on a file :
chmod 755 file.txt
(Give all the permissions to the user and permissions to read and execute to the group and the others)

There are other permissions : t-bit (the owner is the only one who can delete the file), the SUID (executable only by the owner) and the SGID (executable by the group of the file).
