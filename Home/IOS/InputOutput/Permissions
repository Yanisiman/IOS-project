First the permission to access files is divided into three users: 
- The user / owner
- The group
- The others / all

Each type of user on a file has the permission or not to : read / write / execute.
There are other permissions : t-bit (the owner is the only one who can delete the file), the SUID (executable only by the owner) and the SGID (executable by the group of the file).
