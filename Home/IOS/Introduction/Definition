An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

It's actually the bridge between the software (logical part) and the the hardware (physical part) to make it easier to user the different physical components.
The Operating system is a resource manager based on virtualizations (CPU, memory) and which aims to protect the content of the users through isolation and security.
