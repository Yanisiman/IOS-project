An Operating system has 2 modes : the kernel mode and the user mode.
The code executed in user mode is limited in its actions.
On the contrary, the kernel mode has no limits and can execute code without restrictions.
User mode can perform privileged actions thanks to system calls making the link between the user program and the operating system.

The only way a user space application can explictlt initiate a switch to kernel mode during normal operation is by making a system call such as open, read, write, etc.
Whenever a user application calls these system calls with appropriate parameters, a software interrupt is triggered.
A user can also do some privileged actions through commands which will switch to kernel mode to execute them.
