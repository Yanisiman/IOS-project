The RAM memory is located randomly and it needs energy to be stored. It's a temporary memory and its access is much faster to read and write information. It's often used to save the status of a program and change between different tasks.

Storage memory is a permanent storage where files are saved such as OS and the necessary files to boot the computer. Its access is not as fast as RAM memory.
