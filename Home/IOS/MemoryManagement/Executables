There are four stages for a C program to become an executable:
1. Pre-processing : This is the very first satge through which a source code passes. In this stage the following tasks are done :
    - Macro substitution
    - Comments are stripped off
    - Expansion of the included files.
2. Compilation : Translate code to assembly code.
3. Assembly : Translate assembly code to machine code.
4. Linking : Resolve address of external routines and generate executable.
