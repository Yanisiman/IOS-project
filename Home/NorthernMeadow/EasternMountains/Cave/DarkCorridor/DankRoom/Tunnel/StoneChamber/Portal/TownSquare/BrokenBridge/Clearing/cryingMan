“You! You’re a magic-user! I can tell, you’ve got that look. Come to finish
the job, have you? Well, go ahead, do your worst— there’s nothing else you can take from
me. Not since the rest of you were here a few days ago.
…
What happened? You DARE to ask— you know perfectly well what happened. Your
friends, the wizard’s minions, destroyed my house and kidnapped my poor daughter, that’s
what! My wife even went into town to look for help, and I haven’t heard from her since!
…
Hm? Well, I guess it’s true that you don’t look like one of the wizard’s minions. Still, I don’t
trust you magicfolk. If you really are who you say you are, then prove your good intentions
by making me a new House!”
